# `st-solarized-both`

## What

A modified patch of a patch (https://st.suckless.org/patches/solarized/) that fixes the wrong color name problem, e.g. `white` actually being black. 

The keybind to switch colors is still `F6`.

## Issues

You have to reset the terminal twice (`^L` x2) for the color change to take effect. I don't know how to fix this.
